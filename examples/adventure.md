# Example: *Adventure!*

```ink
# Start by creating the scene for the players.
"Ready for an adventure?" you ask the players sitting before you at the table. 
You consult your notes and begin to read.
"Before you stands a {~forest|mine|fortress} filled with {~humans|mermaids|gnomes|elves}. <>
# Next, pick something visually notable.
Looking closely, you see a {~shrine|tower|grotto}."
```

In the example *Adventure!*, multiple shuffle alternatives are used to generate dynamic content for a player. Glue is used between lines with a comment between them.
