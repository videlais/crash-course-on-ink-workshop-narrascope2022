# Tools Needed

Writing in the narrative scripting language ink does not technically require any specific digital tool other than software capable of creating a text file. However, Inky, an editor created by the same developers behind the ink language itself, Inkle, helps authors see possible output as they type it and can create builds for web-based projects.

**For those just starting with ink, Inky is the preferred editing tool.**

## Getting Inky

The [releases page](https://github.com/inkle/inky/releases) of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/inkle/inky) always has the latest build. At the time of this writing, it is 0.13.0.

## Using Inky

Depending on the operating system and permissions, using Inky the first time might be a little tricky. As Inkle does not have licensing agreements with Microsoft or Apple, Inky can sometimes be flagged as "downloaded software" and not run immediately. In these cases, make sure Inky is allowed to run before attempting to write or use any ink code with it.
