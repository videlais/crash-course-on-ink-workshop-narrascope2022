# Crash Course on ink (NarraScope 2022)

Welcome to a workshop on the [narrative scripting language ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink)! This is a *crash course*, which means we will try, in less than an hour, to help you learn the basics of the language and how to use it to author projects.

**50 minutes is absolutely not enough time to learn everything related to ink**, but we hope everyone will leave with an interest in learning about ink after the workshop ends! We will cover some of the basics and share extended resources for doing more with the narrative scripting language.
